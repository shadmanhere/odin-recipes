    <h1>Chicken Biryani</h1>
    <img src="../images/chickenbirayni.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Biryani in India doesn't just mean biryani. There are variations across the length and breadth of the country. There is Hyderabadi biryani (which is what I'm sharing today) where the biryani has a lot of gravy or masala and is cooked slowly with rice in a sealed pot. Then there is the Muslim wedding biryani which actually has lesser masala, but packed with flavour mostly from whole spices; the Kerala biryani, donne biryani from Karnataka and so many more.</p>
    <p>In every single form, biryani is delicious and is almost like a one pot meal that's enjoyed by families and eaten together - like a celebration!</p>
    <p>But I have to be a 100% honest with you. I had never made chicken biryani before I decided to share this recipe. And I got convinced because so so many of you have requested for a legit/authentic biryani recipe that was also relatively easy.</p>
    <p>And we are biryani lovers. Mostly mutton biryani, but this chicken biryani really changed our mind.</p>
    <p>The first time I attempted it, I was nervous, because it seemed so difficult and daunting and it looked like there were a gazillion steps. So I took a deep breath and decided to break them down for you</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
        <li>4 small potatoes, peeled and halved</li>
        <li>2 large onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 medium tomatoes, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        <li>1 (2 inch) piece cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken pieces cut into chunks</li>
        <!-- Rice -->
        <li>1 pound basmati rice</li>
        <li>2 ½ tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 pinch powdered saffron</li>
        <li>5 pods cardamom</li>
        <li>3 whole cloves</li>
        <li>1 (1 inch) piece cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until brown. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and set aside.</li>
    <li>Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil to the skillet and fry onions, garlic, and fresh ginger until onion is soft and golden. Add chili, pepper, turmeric, cumin, salt, and tomatoes. Fry, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if the mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan.</li>
    <li>When mixture is thick and smooth, add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when the chicken is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.</li>
    <li>To prepare rice: Wash rice well and drain in colander for at least 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a large skillet. Fry onion in hot oil until golden. Add saffron, cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and rice. Stir continuously until rice is coated with spices.</li>
    <li>Heat stock and salt in a medium pot. When the mixture is hot, pour it over the rice and stir well. Add the chicken mixture and potatoes; gently mix them into the rice. Bring to boil. Cover the saucepan tightly, turn heat to very low, and steam for 20 minutes. Do not lift lid or stir while cooking. Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.</li>
